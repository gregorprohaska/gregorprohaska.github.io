title: Install Analysis Services Extension for Visual Studio Community
categories: [SQL, SSAS, SSIS, SSRS]
---

Visual Studio is the tool to create all kind of SQL-related solution, e.g. Database-projects, Integartion Servicee Solutions and Analysis Service Solutions (especially OLAP-Solution). Today I install Visual Studio Community 2022 [^1] at a newly setup server to do exactly this.

Shortly after installing and opening it I noticed that the extensions for SSAS, SSIS and SSRS are not (yet) supported and I had to install Visual Studio Community 2019. It took me a while to find the place where Microsoft hides it's old versions. I'm not sure why this wasn't the first hit in my chosen search engine but for future reference I will store it her: [Downloadpage Visual studio community 2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes)


[^1]: creation of sql-projects is covered by the [license terms](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/license-terms/vs2022-ga-community/) of Visual Studio Community
